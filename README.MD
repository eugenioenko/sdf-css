# SDF CSS Framework
(in progress)

## Design Principle
The idea of this framework is to create the minimal set of class names which should style contextually the maximum amount of elements.

## Theme Colors
The framework implements a set of theme color modifiers which regardless of their combination should present all the elements cohesively and clean.

## Grid System
SDF CSS grid is a combination of flexbox and clearfix bock.
By having separated the cell/col width class modifier it's possible to have both grid systems coexist in the same space without adding extra weight to the stylesheet files.
