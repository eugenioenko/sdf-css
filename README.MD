# SDF CSS Framework
(in progress)

## Design Principle
The idea of this framework is to create a minimal set of classes names by which it should be possible to style a whole page without the need to write extra styles.

## Grid System
SDF CSS grid is a combination of flexbox and clearfix bock.
By having separated the cell/col width class modifier it's possible to have both grid systems coexist in the same space without adding extra weight to the stylesheet files.
