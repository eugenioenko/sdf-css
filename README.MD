# SDF CSS Framework
(in progress)

## Design Principle
The idea of this framework is to create the minimal set of classes names which sould style contextually the maximum amount of elements posible.

## Theme Colors
The framework implements a set of theme color modifiers which regardless of their combination should present all the elements cohesively and clean.

## Grid System
SDF CSS grid is a combination of flexbox and clearfix bock.
By having separated the cell/col width class modifier it's possible to have both grid systems coexist in the same space without adding extra weight to the stylesheet files.
All the width calculations are done using the CSS "calc" function to maximize the floating point precision across all the browsers.
